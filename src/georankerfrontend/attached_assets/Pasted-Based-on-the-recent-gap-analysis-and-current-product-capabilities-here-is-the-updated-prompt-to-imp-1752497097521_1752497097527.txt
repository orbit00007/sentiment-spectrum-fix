Based on the recent gap analysis and current product capabilities, here is the updated prompt to implement refined UI and feature enhancements for your GEO dashboard, ensuring enterprise-grade clarity, efficiency, and depth:

Analytics Screen:

Clearly separate sections for AI Visibility and Community Analytics with bold, intuitive headings.

Add interactive filtering (by LLM, time period, competitor).

Introduce a content opportunity section that identifies missing visibility for tracked keywords, with a one-click action to create a content brief.

Visualize performance trends with graphs and include top-performing vs. underperforming keyword callouts.

Content Hub Screen:

Split into three tabs: Plan, Create, and Optimize to reduce visual clutter.

Integrate a feedback loop: show underperforming content → recommend updates or repurposing → generate new briefs.

Add LLM-specific optimization fields (e.g., LLM Readiness Score, Prompt Friendliness, Citation Density).

Include repurpose automation for old case studies, blog content, and underutilized assets.

Simplify brief cards by default (only title, format, performance); expand to show tone, CTA, headlines, etc.

Dashboard Overview Screen:

Highlight a "Visibility Gap Tracker": show the difference between current and target visibility scores, with contributor content insights.

Prioritize 2–3 key recommended actions on load (e.g., "Missing content on Gemini," "No case study ranking on ChatGPT").

Collapse secondary metrics and sentiment breakdowns into expandable sections to reduce visual noise.

Integrations Screen:

Clarify integration status visually (Connected / Not Connected with color states).

Recommend integrations based on missing content types (e.g., “Integrate Product Hunt for case study mentions”).

Add a guided setup wizard for new users with pre-populated demo content to simulate value quickly.

Profile Settings Screen:

Use a checklist-style interface to show completion status: profile, topics tracked, integrations, wiki/G2/Product Hunt presence.

Surface alerts when important visibility channels (e.g., Wikipedia or G2) are missing.

Reports Screen:

Consolidate multiple report types (e.g., AI Search Report, Content Action Plan, Community Summary) into 2 main types:

Visibility Report

Content Strategy Report
with toggles to include/exclude sections.

Add a "Quick Insights" preview for each report card showing metrics change, urgent actions, and top keyword trends.

Let users configure which reports should be sent weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly with smart scheduling.

New Functional Additions:

Mention Mining Tool: Upload or enter public URLs (blogs, videos, case studies) and scan for keyword mentions and content gaps.

LLM Optimization Panel: Show a real-time score for each content piece and improvement suggestions based on LLM visibility best practices.

Collaboration Layer: Let users assign briefs or optimization tasks to team members, add comments, and mark stages (Draft, Review, Approved).

General Cleanup & Reductions:

Reduce scattered "Take Action" buttons; instead embed one-click actions inline within content cards.

Avoid overloading report and dashboard screens with too many minor metrics. Prioritize top-level insights with expandable detail.

Merge or simplify redundant modules across reporting and community visibility.

Ensure modular React components and Tailwind-based styling are used throughout, keeping each view responsive, minimal, and suitable for scale.

No backend needed for now — all sections can use placeholder states, mocked content, and simple state toggling for interaction simulation.
